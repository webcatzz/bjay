It was an aesthetic education to live within those walls.
x Since the days when, as a schoolboy,
x I used to bicycle round the neighbouring parishes,
x rubbing brasses and photographing fonts,
x I had nursed a love of architecture,
x but my sentiments at heart were insular and medieval.
x This was my conversion to the Baroque.

Why is this house called a "castle"?

as Sebastian
Because it used to be one until they moved it.

opt What *can* you mean?

	as Sebastian
	Just that.
	It used to be a castle about a mile away, down by the village.
	Then when they took a fancy to the valley
	and pulled the castle down, carted it stone by stone up here,
	and built a new house.
	I'm rather glad they did, aren't you?

	If it was mine, I couldn't live anywhere else.
	
	as Sebastian
	But it isn't really mine.
	I mean, just at the moment it is,
	but usually it's full of ravening beasts.
	
	as Charles
	If it could only be like this always --
	always alone, always summer,
	the fruit always ripe,
	and Aloysius always in a good temper.
